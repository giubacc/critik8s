# Why critik8s

Our goal is to create a project that offers us the opportunity to improve our frontend and backend skills and at the same time develop a useful tool for kubernetes clusters.

## Context and Problem Statement

it will signals RWO pods failures, in his first version.

 - Reactivity because we want to offer strong performance and user experiense on the frontend side.
